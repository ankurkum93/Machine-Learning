# Machine-Learning
Its a Titanic Dataset that I have used from Kaggle 
I have made a correlation matrix to check which field is most related to survived.
Then I have compared the relation of other fields individually with Survived.
I investigated the missing values in the dataset.
I filled the value '0' where missing values were not so much like in Fare, there was only one missing value.
In Embarked, I filled the values as S as that was the most appeared value and there were only 2 missing values.
I decided to drop cabin column as it had lots of missing values.
Rest, I have used 3 Algorithms namely Random Forest classifier, Logistic Regression and K-NN classifier.
